# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?: A case study of Cyclistic

I created this project as a case study to showcase my abilities in data analysis and visualization. It was developed after completing the Google Data Analytics specialization.

## Description

- I'm a junior data analyst working at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago.
- The marketing team at Cyclistic wants to understand the differences in usage between casual riders and annual members in order to design a new marketing strategy to convert more casual riders into annual members.
- To gain approval for your recommendations, you will need to provide compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to support your ideas.


## About the company (Cyclistic)

- Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program in Chicago with a fleet of over 5,800 bikes and 692 stations.
- Cyclistic offers a range of pricing options, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are called Cyclistic members.
- Annual members are more profitable for Cyclistic than casual riders, and the marketing team is interested in converting more casual riders into annual members.
